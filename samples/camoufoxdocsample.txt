Usage

Camoufox is fully compatible with your existing Playwright code. You only have to change your browser initialization:
Sync API
Async API

from camoufox.async_api import AsyncCamoufox

async with AsyncCamoufox() as browser:
    page = await browser.new_page()
    await page.goto("https://example.com")

#
Parameters List

All Playwright Firefox launch options are accepted, along with the following:
#
Device Rotation

Camoufox will generate device information for you based on the following parameters.
os

Type: Optional[ListOrString]

Operating system to use for the fingerprint generation. Can be "windows", "macos", "linux", or a list to randomly choose from. By default, Camoufox will randomly choose from a list of all three.

# Use a specific OS
with Camoufox(os="windows") as browser:
    ...

# Randomly choose from a list of OS
with Camoufox(os=["windows", "macos", "linux"]) as browser:
    ...

fonts

Type: Optional[List[str]]

Fonts to load into Camoufox, in addition to the default fonts for the target os. Takes a list of font family names that are installed on the system.

Fonts & font fingerprinting
../../fingerprint/fonts/

custom_fonts = ["Arial", "Helvetica", "Times New Roman"]
with Camoufox(fonts=custom_fonts) as browser:
    ...

screen

Type: Optional[Screen]

Constrains the screen dimensions of the generated fingerprint. Takes a browserforge.fingerprints.Screen instance.

While this sets the screen dimensions, it has very light impact on the size of the window. Sometimes the window will be larger, sometimes smaller.

from browserforge.fingerprints import Screen

constrains = Screen(max_width=1920, max_height=1080)
with Camoufox(screen=constrains) as browser:
...

webgl_config

Type: Optional[Tuple[str, str]]

Use a specific WebGL vendor/renderer pair. Passed as a tuple of (vendor, renderer). The vendor & renderer combination must be supported for the target os or this will cause leaks.

Check here for a list of Camoufox's supported vendor & renderer combinations.

with Camoufox(
    webgl_config=("Apple", "Apple M1, or similar"),
    os="macos",
) as browser:
    ...

config

Type: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]

If needed, individual Camoufox config properties can be overridden by passing them as a dictionary to the config parameter. This can be used to enable features that have not yet been implemented into the Python library.
warning

This is an advanced feature and should be used with caution. The Camoufox Python library is designed to populate these properties for you.

Passing config
../config/

#
Configuration

Extra feature configuration and quality of life options.
humanize

Type: Optional[Union[bool, float]]

Humanize the cursor movement. Takes either True, or the MAX duration in seconds of the cursor movement. The cursor typically takes up to 1.5 seconds to move across the window.

Cursor movement info & demo
../../fingerprint/cursor-movement/

# Enable humanization with default settings
with Camoufox(humanize=True) as browser:
    ...

# Set a custom max duration for cursor movement
with Camoufox(humanize=2.0) as browser:
    ...

headless

Type: Optional[Union[bool, Literal['virtual']]]

Whether to run the browser in headless mode. Defaults to False. If you are running linux, passing 'virtual' will use Xvfb.

Virtual Display
../virtual-display/

# Run in headless mode
with Camoufox(headless=True) as browser:
    ...

# Run in headless mode on linux
with Camoufox(headless="virtual") as browser:
    ...

addons

Type: Optional[List[str]]

List of Firefox addons to use. Must be paths to extracted addons.

To load an .xpi file, rename it to a .zip file, extract it, and pass the extracted folder.

addons = ["/path/to/addon1", "/path/to/addon2"]
with Camoufox(addons=addons) as browser:
    ...

exclude_addons

Type: Optional[List[DefaultAddons]]

Exclude the default addons. Passed as a list of camoufox.DefaultAddons enums.

Default addons
../../fingerprint/addons/#default-addons

window

Type: Optional[Tuple[int, int]]

Set the window size in (width, height) pixels. This will also set the window.screenX and window.screenY properties to position the window at the center of the generated screen.

Camoufox will automatically generate a window size for you. Using a fixed window size can lead to fingerprinting. Do not set the window size to a fixed value unless for debugging purposes.

with Camoufox(window=(1282, 955)) as browser:
    ...

main_world_eval

Type: Optional[bool]

Whether to inject scripts into the main world when prefixed with mw:

with Camoufox(main_world_eval=True) as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
    # Modify the DOM
    page.evaluate("mw:document.querySelector('h1').remove()")

See more info
../main-world-eval/

enable_cache

Type: Optional[bool]

Whether to cache previous pages, requests, etc. Disabled by default as it uses more memory.

Keeping this disabled will not allow you to use the page.go_back() or page.go_forward() methods.

with Camoufox(enable_cache=True) as browser:
    ...

persistent_context

Type: Optional[bool]

Whether to create a persistent context. Requires user_data_dir.

with Camoufox(
    persistent_context=True,
    user_data_dir='/path/to/profile/dir',
) as context:
    ...

#
Location & Language

Prevent proxy detection by matching your geolocation & locale with your target IP. This will populate the Geolocation & Intl properties for you.
geoip

Type: Optional[Union[str, bool]]

Calculates longitude, latitude, timezone, country, & locale based on the IP address. Pass the target IP address to use, or True to find the IP address automatically.

Geolocation & Proxies
../geoip/

# Use a specific IP address
with Camoufox(geoip="203.0.113.0", proxy=...) as browser:
    ...

# Automatically find the IP address
with Camoufox(geoip=True, proxy=...) as browser:
    ...

locale

Type: Optional[Union[str, List[str]]]

Locale(s) to use in Camoufox. Can be a list of strings, or a single string separated by a comma. The first locale in the list will be used for the Intl API.

# Use a single locale
with Camoufox(locale="en-US") as browser:
    ...

# Generate a language based on the distribution of speakers the US
with Camoufox(locale="US") as browser:
    ...

# Use multiple accepted locales
with Camoufox(locale=["en-US", "fr-FR", "de-DE"]) as browser:
    ...
with Camoufox(locale="en-US,fr-FR,de-DE") as browser:
    ...

#
Toggles

Shortcuts for common Firefox preferences and security toggles.
block_images

Type: Optional[bool]

Blocks all requests to images. This can help save your proxy usage.

with Camoufox(block_images=True) as browser:
    ...

block_webrtc

Type: Optional[bool]

Blocks WebRTC entirely.

with Camoufox(block_webrtc=True) as browser:
    ...

block_webgl

Type: Optional[bool]

Whether to block WebGL. To prevent leaks, only use this for special cases.

with Camoufox(block_webgl=True) as browser:
    ...

disable_coop

Type: Optional[bool]

Disables the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP). This allows elements in cross-origin iframes, such as the Turnstile checkbox, to be clicked.

# Cloudflare turnstile example
with Camoufox(disable_coop=True, window=(1280, 720)) as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto('https://nopecha.com/demo/cloudflare')
    page.wait_for_load_state(state="domcontentloaded")
    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')
    page.wait_for_timeout(5000)  # 5 seconds
    page.mouse.click(210, 290)
    ...

Camoufox will warn you if your passed configuration might cause leaks.
